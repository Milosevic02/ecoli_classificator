# E. coli Bacteria Classification

## Project Description

This project focuses on the classification of E. coli bacteria based on their sequence characteristics. The goal of the project is to build a neural network capable of classifying E. coli bacteria into appropriate groups using the available data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains previously collected data on E. coli bacteria sequences. The dataset includes information on various sequence characteristics, such as mcg, gvh, lip, chg, aac, alm1, and alm2.

## Possible Classes

The classification of E. coli bacteria involves predicting the bacteria's membership in one of the following classes:

1. cp: Cytoplasmic proteins
2. im: Inner membrane without signal
3. imS: Inner membrane with signal
4. imL: Inner membrane with extended signal
5. imU: Inner membrane with unknown signal
6. om: Outer membrane
7. omL: Outer membrane with signal
8. pp: Periplasmic proteins

## Accuracy

The accuracy of the model is typically around 90% for both the Train and Test sets.
